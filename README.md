# touch 

Somewhat like the Unix touch command for Windows users.


### why?
I needed/wanted to be able to touch files like in Unix. I looked 
around and found a few different options then decided to write my 
own because I could. This way I'm also not installing some rando
binary on my system. I have nobody else to blame but myself if this
code does me dirty.
